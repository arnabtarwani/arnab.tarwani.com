> Here is the tragedy: when you are the victim of depression, not only do you feel utterly helpless and abandoned by the world, you also know that very few people can understand, or even begin to believe, that life can be this painful. There is nothing I can think of that is quite as isolating as this. — Giles Andreae


I’ve been reading a plethora of articles day in and day out on Medium, but never thought to write my own. I want to share my thoughts and feelings and thus it’s high time. With this article, the title will make more sense, I’m initiating a journey to enlighten people with my knowledge and beliefs.

> It is awful to see people, no matter how hard they try, end up doing something that is against their volition and the abysmal part is, they lose themselves in the long run.

I come from a country where respecting elders’ opinions and decisions are onus and agreeing to them is the only option (I am not exaggerating). The latter may be abominable but it is the truth and the majority of the population is under this influence.

For instance, a child’s fate is determined at a very young age and leads to a foundation of repercussions which provoke reprehensible alterations in one’s life.

How you might ask. Well, a child who desires to be an artist, wants to travel the world to search for peace, harmony and make art, is ordained to be a doctor. He eventually becomes one, but deep down in his heart, the crushed dream resides to burst out sometime in life. Unfortunately, gets buried along with him in the grave.

Why is it like this? I don’t know.

What I notice is, people are unable to take a step forward and speak their heart out because etiquette stands in their way. The values to respect elders and their decisions curb them to speak and consequently, they find themselves in a situation which affects their lives drastically.

If this child had the audacity to raise a voice for his passion, he might be a different person today. If he had made his decisions and decided to follow his dreams, he could have been a renowned artist, who knows, but all this was sabotaged because of not raising his voice.

*Raising a voice is an initiative that the child could’ve taken to secure his future but failing to do so, lead to a different course of life from where there is no return.*

*There is a turnaround but the gravity of consequences might be greater which he may have to face unwillingly. Those consequences — again — he might be willing to tackle, but it will impact the people around him which would restrict him to take perilous decisions.*

*Overall, this child stumbles heavily in life because of his past actions to not assert himself in front of elder’s.*

I am insisting on the word “initiate” because one can only understand the value of life if he starts something. It doesn’t matter what you want to commence, just take the first step.

Want to be successful?

Want to write a book?

Want to be rich?

Want to build a mansion?

Everything happens only when you start, initiate what you want to achieve. Life is short. If you want to accomplish greater things you need a kick off. Don’t worry if you have a slow beginning. Rome wasn’t built in a day so take one step at a time and surely you’ll witness positive results.

> Just try new things. Don’t be afraid. Step out of your comfort zones and soar, all right? — Michelle Obama

What is it that you haven’t tried yet? What scares you the most? What makes you vulnerable and weak?

Well it’s time to overcome those fears. You have spent a lot of time thinking about those vulnerabilities and now is the time to take your initial step to victory.

> Don’t let fear or insecurity stop you from trying new things. Believe in yourself. Do what you love. And most importantly, be kind to others, even if you don’t like them. — Stacy London

In fact, whatever you want to accomplish is within your reach. You just need the fire to emerge and burn. You are your own Tony Stark, Mother Teresa, Gandhi and Obama.

Be born like a legend. Live like a legend. And die like a legend.

*Thanks a lot, if you loved the article please clap and share with your friends. This is my first try so it might sound a bit emotional and cheesy. But I’ll definitely appreciate your presence and hope you follow me for future enlightening articles.*
